# page_builder
PHP Templating CMS

Pagebuilder is a Content Manager that enables rapid-prototyping by separating processing logic from HTML content.  It implements strict Separation of Concerns so that the back end adds nothing to the page, and page content is controlled exclusively by HTML templates which are fragments with embedded variables.
